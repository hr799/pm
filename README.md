# Performance Management(PM)
---
Source code for the performance management application. 
This application is based on the “Kōrero” framework employed by Deloitte.


## Description
---
The Performance Management application aims to carry over the principles of Kōrero to a technology platform, available
on iOS, Android and Web.  

Kōrero is built off a coach and coachee hierarchy system where employees may coach or be coached by one another. 
Coaches are able to monitor their coachee's progress with concern to their current projects progress 
by viewing notes attached to a particular project, known as a "diary". Diaries act as the main insight to gaining
an understanding of a coachee's thought process and approach on a project. 

## Features
---
* The PM application contains a web admin panel where an administrator may add, edit and delete articles, which are
broadcasted to all users on the home screen of the application.
* Users are able to create projects and diaries attached to projects.
* Users are able to coach multiple coachee's.
* Users are able to view all currently signed up users on the application and are able to send a request to be coached by another user.
Users can accept or decline said request.
* Coaches can view and access their current coachees profiles and projects/diaries via their profile.
* Users can record goal entries within projects.
* Users can record their year end goals via their profile.
